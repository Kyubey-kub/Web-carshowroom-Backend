npm install


Set up environment variables in a .env file:
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=yourpassword
DB_NAME=car_showroom
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password


Start the server:
npm start


The server will run on http://localhost:5000.


API Endpoints
